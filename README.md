# Retail Sales Decline Analysis (2015–2024)

🧩 Project Overview

A mega retail store experienced continuous sales and revenue decline after more than 10 years of growth.
I was engaged as a data analyst to identify the true root causes behind the decline using historical sales data.

This project documents my full investigation — from trend analysis and customer behavior to pricing strategy, loyalty, and profitability.

All analysis was performed using Excel & Power BI.

🎯 Objectives

-- Identify when sales began to decline

-- Understand what changed in customer behavior

-- Evaluate the impact of pricing & discount strategy

-- Investigate the loyalty paradox (rising loyalty, falling revenue)

Recommend data-driven actions for recovery

📊 Key Findings

-- Sales peaked in 2018–2019 and declined steadily afterward

-- The business relied heavily on the Grocery category (>65% of total units)

-- High-value in-store customers declined while online customers increased

-- Discounts increased sharply after 2021, eroding profit margins

-- Customer loyalty was driven by discounts — not brand trust

-- Returns surged in 2023–2024, further reducing net revenue

This behavior created what I call "The Loyalty Illusion" — the appearance of stability masking deeper profitability issues.

💡 Recommendations

Reduce dependency on deep discounting

Diversify category revenue beyond Groceries

Rebuild in-store engagement for high-value customers

Implement data-driven loyalty strategy

Address return-related product and service issues

🛠 Tools Used
